# Workout Management API

## Overview

This is a simple Express.js application designed to manage workout data. It provides RESTful endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting workouts. The application uses a JSON file for storing workout data and includes middleware for parsing requests, handling cookies, and serving static files.

## Features

- **Create Workouts:** Add new workouts with detailed information.
- **Retrieve Workouts:** Get a list of all workouts or a specific workout by its ID.
- **Update Workouts:** Modify details of an existing workout.
- **Delete Workouts:** Remove a workout by its ID.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
